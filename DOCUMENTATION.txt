The code above is a Python script that includes inline documentation. Here is the documentation for each part of the code:

1. Importing necessary modules:
   - `import requests`: This module allows sending HTTP requests in Python.
   - `from datetime import *`: This module provides classes for manipulating dates and times.
   - `import time`: This module provides various time-related functions.

2. Setting up the authentication key for accessing the Telegram Bot:
   - `key_token`: A string variable that stores the authentication key/token for accessing the Telegram Bot.

3. Defining a function for sending messages to a Telegram chat:
   - `envio(mensagem)`: This function sends a message to a chat in Telegram.
   - Args:
     - `mensagem (str)`: The message to be sent.
   - Returns:
     - None

4. Initializing variables:
   - `aposta`: A string variable that stores the current bet color.
   - `vitoria`: An integer variable that stores the number of wins.
   - `derrota`: An integer variable that stores the number of losses.

5. Main loop:
   - This loop runs indefinitely until interrupted.
   - It performs the following steps in each iteration:
     - Get the current date and time.
     - Format the date and time strings.
     - Construct the URL to retrieve the results of roulette games.
     - Send a GET request to the URL and retrieve the JSON response.
     - Process the results by extracting the colors of the previous games.
     - Check if the current bet color matches the first color in the list of previous games.
     - Update the win or loss count accordingly.
     - Send a message to the Telegram chat with the result of the last bet.
     - Check if all the colors in the list are the same.
     - If all colors are the same, send a signal for a new bet based on the opposite color.
     - Wait for 30 seconds before the next iteration.
